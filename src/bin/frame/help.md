Use `Ctrl-q` to quit :) Just kidding.

# Cursor

Current cursor is highlighted and controlled by a key press or left click.

* `Up` or `Down` moves the cursor up/down a line.
* left click moves the cursor to any line in visual range

# Scrolling

Areas allow scrolling by mouse or key presses like `PageUp` / `PageDown` / `Home` / `End`.

For cursor behavior in scrolling:
* the cursor tries to jump to a previous line for the same content
* if the jump is not viable, it will move or stay as per scrolling

# Dash Board

## Search

Press `Ctrl-f` to switch between these:
* fuzzy search pkgs in local registry panel
* fuzzy search docs in database panel
* fuzzy search in both local registry and database panels

## DataBase

> **NOTE: to switch between database and registry panel, use `Tab` key press.**

### KeyMap

* `Enter`: load a cached doc and enter the Doc Page.
* `Delete`: unload a doc, i.e. the Loaded doc downgrades to Cached.

### Mouse

* Double click on the cursor item: same as `Enter` key press to load a doc.
* Right click on the cursor item: same as `Delete` key press to unload a doc.

## Registry

Local registry provides the source packages, and docs are generated by these pkgs.

It lies in your `~/.cargo/registry/src/` on Linux system, for example.

### KeyMap

* `Enter`: start a task to compile the doc

> **NOTE: there is no way to cancel a starting doc compilation.**

# Doc Page

> **NOTE: meaningless click in DashBoard can switch to Page.**

> **NOTE: Use `Ctrl-w` in both Page and DashBoard to switch between them!**

From left to right, there are *outline* panel, *content* panel and *navi* panel.

## Outline

### KeyMap

Mainly to control the outline tree nodes by folding/expansion:
* `Enter`: expand/fold a single node.
* `/`: expand all nodes.
* `0`: only expand zero level nodes that directly under the root node.
     This means modules under root will be folded.
* `1`: expand zero and first level nodes that under the root node till the first depth.
     This means modules under first-level modules will be folded.
* `m`: only expand the current module including nested one in it, but with other modules
     that doesn't share the same ancestor from root folded.

Some keymaps to control cursor position like Vim:
* `L`: move the cursor to bottom node in current view range.
* `H`: move the cursor to top line in current view range.
* `M`: move the cursor to middle line in current view range.

### Mouse

* Double click: same as `Enter` key press to expand or fold a node.
* Left click: select a tree node and display the markdown doc in content panel.

## Content 

Aside from the scrolling control, there is one `d` keymap to toggle the markdown rendering.

Since this program uses custom parsing to hightlight markdown and wrap texts, we only use
`syntect` crate to hightlight syntaxes in codeblocks.

If you want the original markdown content from raw json docs, `d` key press will switch
to render them for you with hightlighting from `syntect`.

# TOC

Markdown content can be scrollable with TOC on the right!

TOC is featured as
* auto-updated: it always hightlight the headings in visual range.
* clickable: it jumps to a place where the heading is moved to the top.
